# Release Notes version 1 POC

### Main Mechanic
 * This milestone focused on getting the combat-combo system up and running.
 * Demo: Can do the combos and see that they happened in the console. Can also perform these combos on a dummy enemy.
  
### Brief Development Reflection
 * The majority of the goals for this milestone were hit. I had been hoping to have the enemy built out a little more (so that it would move and react to being hit).
 * A good majority of the work on this milestone went into setting things up for the input system.
 * I finished all the github issues I made for this milestone.
 * See [Devlog file](https://github.com/IAMColumbia/gp2portfoliogame-CiarennHollis/blob/master/src/BurnoutBuster/Devlog.md) for more information about the development of this milestone.
  
###  Questions/Concerns
 * Ask Jeff about the animatable sprite -> how to implement
