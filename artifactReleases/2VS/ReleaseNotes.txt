## Sprint/Story Review
I didn't get all that I wanted done this sprint since I didn't take into account how much time implementing collision would take. That throw off my dev plan for this project and so there are a few mechanics that aren't as fleshed out as I'd like them to be for this submission. I did what I could to get the basic game loop up and going, it will be refined for the next submission.
